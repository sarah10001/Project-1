# MOVIE INDUSTRY EXPLORATION

Venturing into movie production can be a lucrative and glamorous business, and yet a highly risky endevor.
It is therefore important to choose moves into the movie industry wisely and with precaution.
The movie genres range from drama, comedy, action, adventure, horror, sciFi, and many more. 
Sometimes there is a thin line between movies that we are unable to distinguish one genre from the other. 
In such instances, we find that we can have romance/comedy or comedy/drama or even action/comedy.
